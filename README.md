## Chalkboard UI

Chalkboard is the UI for Atom that does a pretty good job of creating a chalkboard that matches your choice of syntax themes. Just what you never knew you always wanted.

Based on the notoriosly brilliant Atom One Dark UI, Chalkboard UI adds scholastic style to your favorite editor using colors from your syntax theme.

Known Bugs
* Cockroaches
* Textures don't scroll with contet like real chalkboards
* Impervious to fingernails, no fun
